User Story: Before and After Run 
(pink-highlighted points are failure points, green-highlighted points are references to other user stories)

As a logged-in user who is about to go for a run/start a workout, I want to be able to… 

Generate a Spotify playlist that will match my historical heart rate data on my previous workouts, using data from my FitBit/Apple Watch. 
The playlist should be generated based on my Spotify listening history (ie, play songs from genres/artists I enjoy) and/or based on the form I filled out in which I input my genre preferences [see Initial Use story]. 
The playlist should also be generated based on the type of workout I’m doing.
I should be able to enter an estimated time for my planned workout, in order for the playlist to be tailored to my running time. 
There should be a clear button that says ‘generate playlist’ after I’ve put in the data.
The songs that the app generates should be queued up for me on Spotify. 
If there’s not enough historical data (I don’t have at least 1 runs/workouts logged on my health app), the app should display a message saying something like “Not enough historical data! Log 1 workout to use the app.”
If I only have between 1 and 5 workouts logged, show a warning message letting me know that limited data might give me a less accurate playlist.  
After my run, input feedback on how well the playlist functioned.
Whether I enjoyed the songs?
Songs I enjoyed and would like to save to my library. 
If I hated songs or artists, designate those songs/artists to never be shown to me again. 
After my run, I want the option to save the playlist to my Spotify library and share it with other users. 
Option to save the playlist to Spotify. 
Option to share my playlist with friends [see Friends story]: format something like “Jessica went on a run today! Here’s what she was listening to…”
