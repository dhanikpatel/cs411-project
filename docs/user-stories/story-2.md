Friends - once logged on through Spotify or Fitbit, I want to have a plethora of friendship features to use. On the app, I can see what my friends are doing on the side bar. I can choose to click on their profile picture to extend more information about what they have done over the past few days. I can see what workouts they finished and what public playlists they made.  
I should be able to see some of their public playlists and what workouts they have finished. It is a good way for me to be inspired by what my other friends or users are doing on the app. One main feature is to be able to share their playlists created by this web app with other users. However, I would want this information to stay private if I choose to do so, because privacy is, first and foremost, important. I want to feel comfortable sharing my playlists when I choose to do so, rather than being forced to share it. Sometimes it might create a playlist that I am not particularly fond of sharing.
Some criteria:
When logging in, have an option for me to import all my friends from my spotify or fitbit app if they are also using the app.
My account is full of created playlists and I have the ability to share these with other users if I choose to do so
I should be able to visually see the friends that I am connected to and be able to see if they are using my playlists for their own workouts
Playlists should not be able to be modified unless the user chooses to have a collaborative playlist with another user
