Use Case Name: User History’s Visualization  
Primary Actor: Spotify, Healthkit, & Fitbit
Secondary Actors: User Dashboard & Database System

The user’s history of the past week will be transformed into data visualizations. For the application to provide an output of the visualization, the user must be logged in. The data visualization will display information like total running distance, total workout duration, number of times worked out, calories burned, songs that were played during high-intense workouts, and other key metrics that relate music with fitness. The data visualization will rely on tables, charts, graphs, and lists to display the quantitative data and provide the information on the dashboard.

The user’s visualization for the past week will automatically be updated and shown to the history every Sunday midnight. The user has the option of turning off the visualization dashboard in user settings. To display the user’s visualization, the user must have worked out at least 2 times for 30 minutes each in the past week so enough information can be collected.

Every Sunday midnight, the dashboard in our web application will be updated to display the user’s new data. This will only take place if the user has worked out 2 times for 30 minutes each. The user can then view the past week’s visualization or any prior week’s visualization by accessing the visualization dashboard. Songs that the user has listened to in the past week and important fitness metrics will be linked. For instance, one specific visualization will include the genre of music or music artists that were linked to calories burned – showing the user in what area did they work out most intensely. Patterns and long-term visualizations will be constantly updated and analyzed on the dashboard to allow the user to track their workouts and the effect of music selected by our application. 

If the user has not worked out in terms of the preconditions, then no visualizations will be provided for that week. The visualization dashboard will not display any visualizations for that past week with a pop-up saying “No Visualization For This Week”. Users can still see their past week’s fitness information and musics listened to – however there will no data visualizations to provide analysis.

After displaying the visualization, the past week’s data will be shown on the top of the data visualization. The user will have the option of selecting the visualization icon to open a new tab that provides in-depth information about past user fitness history.
